Instructions for Running This Code

WARNING: When testing different vaccination strategies, CHANGE THE vaxType variable in the runloop.sh script to correctly save data. Not doing so can result in errors or the overwriting of data. 
Make sure to specifically check the file paths of getData.py and prepData.py. When running PrepData, pass sys.arg argument of the vaccination strategy type aka the name of the folder.

Step 1: Run runloop.sh file until you get desired number of Monte Carlo simulations
Step 2: Run prepData file
Step 3:
